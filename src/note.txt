Step 1--
create a file name with cakeSlice.js according to the reduxtoolkit convention

step 2--
In cakeSlice.js file import createSlice method from reduxToolkit library

Step 3--
We have imported function, now we will invoke the function and assign it to a constant.This function accepts an object as an argument.

Step 4--
In the createSlice method we specify 3 properties to the object
1---property1--specify a name for that particular slice
2--- specify initial state outside of the method
3--- property2-- specify initialState as key and initialState which is created outside of the method as a value.
4--propert3--Specify the reducer function, by adding a key reducers this is an object, within the object we specify the individual state transition,this will have function with state and action as a parameter.

Step 5--
export reducer and actions

//where slice will take care of action type constant and action object (which we created manually in redux)

//reduxtoolkit advantages is ---
* we dont have to explictly return the new state
* we can directly mutate the state (its because createSlice use immer library internaly)
